# [Shifts Reporter](https://szuvi.netlify.com)

This project is React based SPA used on table data copied from Google's Sheet shifts plan to printable PDF form, used to report shifts by the end of month at my workplace.

This project utilizes [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) and [jsPDF-AutoTable](https://github.com/simonbengtsson/jsPDF-AutoTable).
